# Streamlit Learning

This repository serves as a personal learning project to explore and practice building web applications using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). It is not intended as a production-ready application or a template for replication.

## 📚 Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with Streamlit's features and capabilities, including:
- Creating interactive user interfaces
- Utilizing Streamlit widgets
- Managing application state
- Integrating data visualization tools
- Organizing multi-page applications

## 📁 Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- `app.py`: The main entry point of the Streamlit application.
- `pages/`: Contains additional pages for the multi-page Streamlit app.
- `data/`: Directory for sample datasets used within the app.
- `models/`: Placeholder for any machine learning models or related files.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the app.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mancrurod/streamlit-learning.git
